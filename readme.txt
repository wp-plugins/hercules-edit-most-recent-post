Hercules Edit Most Recent Post simply adds a link to the Posts submenu in the wp-admin area to edit the most recent post.

== Description ==

Adds a direct link to publish the most recently published post to the Posts menu.  I was trying to go in and edit my most recent
post and I realized that it is something I do often. I normally have to go to the posts page and then press the link to edit the
most recently published post.  So I decided to save myself a step and add a direct link, thought others might like it too.

Maybe in a future version I'll provide options to add direct links to edit other recently published posts.

Add this plugin by uploading the zip using the "Add Plugin" feature built into Wordpress.  Otherwise manaully unzip the folder

If you hover over the posts menu item in the wp-admin area it should be the last link in the submenu.
